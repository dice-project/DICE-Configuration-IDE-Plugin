\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Conclusion}
The Big Data Auto-Tuning tool has been implemented as a fully integrated solution to finding optimum configuration for big data applications. It consists of a neat user interface in the Eclipse IDE, integrated to a Jenkins server running the BO4CO configuration optimisation tool, that deploys and monitors experiments on a Storm cluster, and retrieves results to the developer on the Eclipse plugin UI.\\
In doing so, the project has overcome challenges to achieve:
\begin{itemize}
\item -	A development environment in the Eclipse IDE, where developers can explore configuration optimisation and the performance of their applications.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item A new SWT-based widget, MultiSelectionCombo, that conforms to conventions and standards, and has been published to the open source community
    \item Extension to the BO4CO code to further this state of the art configuration optimisation tool to support Categoric and Boolean parameters in addition to numerical parameters
	\end{itemize}
\item -	Fully integrated development environment that triggers configuration optimisation on remote automation server and run tests on remote testbed.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Integration between Eclipse and Jenkins for triggering parameterised builds with configuration files remotely, providing an example that integration between the two can be deeper and cover more advanced functionality than existing solutions.
    \item Integrated Jenkins automation server and MATLAB-based BO4CO tool, demonstrating a new viable continuous integration path for MATLAB and Jenkins on Windows-based systems.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Works}
Future works relating to this project can explore the following directions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Big data framework configuration parameters\\
The criteria for inclusion of configuration parameters for this project can be improved with a better understanding of the underlying big data frameworks, and how the parameters are designed to affect operations. There can be more experimentation to collect statistics and more scientifically determine whether a configuration parameter would affect performance of big data applications. This data can also be used to better present the available parameters, by ordering and sorting them for different use cases, providing helpful hints to developers with less knowledge, and provide realistic limits and guideline figures to aid selection.
\item Extra features on the Eclipse plugin\\
	\begin{itemize}
    \item Improved visualisation and analysis of results - Configuration optimisation results can be accompanied with statistics to show how performance has improved over experiment runs.
	\item Saved session and settings - Frequently used settings can be saved and loaded for convenience. The services and test settings usually stays the same across many configuration optimisation experiment runs, only with the parameters changed. The developer will not need to always re-enter such information.
	\end{itemize}
\item Further work on BO4CO configuration optimisation tool\\
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Complete testing for Hadoop big data framework - Fixes to the tool have not been tested on Hadoop
    \item Investigate the performance of configuration optimisation with categorical and boolean parameters - The new capability has been implemented but lacks sufficient testing to statistically validate its performance. There is every reason to believe that it will perform similarly to how it has done with numerical parameters, possibly with a less predictable performance at the initial iterations, but converging to optimal solution after the initial stage.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Dr Giuliano Casale. His guidance to shape the direction of the project, unwavering assistance in fixing the BO4CO tool, and deep knowledge in the project area was invaluable in making this project a success.\\
I would also like to thank Matej Artaƒç for his kind assistance in setting up the numerous tools required; and my second marker, Dr Robert Chatley, for his helpful advice and suggesting new perspectives from which to evaluate the project.
