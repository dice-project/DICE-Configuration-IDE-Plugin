\section{Abstract}
Big Data applications are crucial in the data-driven economy, but the difficulty in configuring these systems for performance makes development inaccessible to less experienced programmers. This project aims to provides a fully integrated development environment built upon DICE tools to accelerate development of big data applications with a fully automated workflow, and integrate all the tools to help developers improve performance of big data applications built on popular technologies at ease.\\
The Big Data Auto-tuning Tool allows developers to select configuration parameters to be optimised, execute performance testing, and view retrieved results from the integrated development environment. The tool integrates with Jenkins automation server, and the extended BO4CO configuration optimisation tool, to deploy tests on big data applications automatically and remotely in the background.
